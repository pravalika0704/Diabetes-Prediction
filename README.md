# Diabetes-Prediction

-- In this project we are building a Machine Learning Modeles it can predict whether a person is having diabetes or not.

-- we use supprt vector machine algorithm.

-- In supervised algorithm we feed data to Machine model and then Machine Learning model learns from data and respective labels.

-- In this case we train our model with several medical information like BMI,Glucose level along with a person having diabetes or not.

-- Once we feed data to SVM model,it tries to plot the graph then it tries to find Hyperplane.

-- Hyperplan separates the data( either - or +).

-- So,once we feed new data to this model so it tries to put that particular data in either of these two groups (by that it can predict a person have diabates or not).
